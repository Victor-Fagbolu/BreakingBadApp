# BreakingBadApp

This breaking bad app was initially devloped in accordance with the requirements outlined in the Challenge, I've added some features I'll outline here.

### Characters Page
    - Added search bar. Able to search character based on either name or nickname
    - Clicking on character will lead to a character's detailed page as outlined in the challenge
    - Star at the top right of picture is a favorites icon. Tapping the star will add the character to the user's favorites.

### Episodes Page
        - Added search bar. Able to search episode based on episode name, season number, episode number. You can even type a character's name and it will bring up all episodes in which the character appears.
        - Completely redesigned episodes page to be more organized and visually appealing usng dropdowns. (There are currently two series because "Better Call Saul" is kind of like a sequal to breaking bad)
        - Expanding a season and taping on an episode will take you to an episode details page.
            - On the episode details page is a banner, information about the episode, and a grid of the main characters from that episode.
            - Tapping on a character the grid will take you to the character details page

### Favorites page
    - Search bar has the same functionality as on characters page
    - If no favorites are chosen the page displays text indicating this.
    - Only characters the user has sselected will appear on this page
    - Tapping on the star will remove this character from the user's favorites.
    - The user's favorites presists when the app is closed and re-opened
